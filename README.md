# Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis as Machine Reading Comprehension

Source code for COLING 2022 paper: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis as Machine Reading Comprehension

> Existing studies typically handle aspect-based sentiment analysis by stacking multiple neural modules, which inevitably result in severe error propagation. Instead, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, {\bf MRCOOL}: {\bf MRC}-Pr{\bf O}mpt m{\bf O}de{\bf L} framework, where numerous sentiment aspects are elicited by a machine reading comprehension (MRC) model and their corresponding sentiment polarities are classified in a prompt learning way. Experiments show that our end-to-end framework consistently yields promising results on widely-used benchmark datasets which significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art models or achieve comparable performance.
